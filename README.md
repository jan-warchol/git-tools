Most common aliases and sensible config options for a more pleasant git
experience.


Installation
------------

Clone the repo and run installation script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jan-warchol/git-ninja-tools
./git-ninja-tools/install.sh
```

Manual installation:
1. Clone this repo
1. Add it to your PATH to make new git commands available
1. Source `bash-completion.sh` in your bash configuration to enable
   autocompletion for new commands
1. Import settings from `.gitconfig` into your git configuration file

### Repository status in prompt

Paste the following snippet to your `.bashrc` to use a simple and elegant
prompt that displays status of your repo:

```bash
# Using \[ and \] is necessary to prevent weird behavior (lines overlapping).
blue="\[\e[94m\]"
cyan="\[\e[96m\]"
reset="\[\e[0m\]"
GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1
GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM="verbose git"
export PS1="${blue}\u ${cyan}\w${reset}\$(__git_ps1)\n\\$ "
```


Features
--------

New commands and common aliases:

- [`git pretty-log`](git-pretty-log) (aliased to `git l`) - clear, readable and
  concise log.
- [`git divergence A B C`](git-divergence) - show how multiple branches `A` `B`
  and `C` differ (relative to common ancestor).
- [`git smart-commit`](git-smart-commit) (aliased to `git ci`) - wrapper for
  `git commit` that automatically includes modified files (if you don't specify
  what to commit) and doesn't require quotes for commit message - example:
  `git ci Update files`
- [`git submodule-details`](git-submodule-details) - see how current submodule
  status is related to what is recorded in the superproject (show relevant
  history graph).  Especially helpful when there are merge conflicts.
- [`git explain-conflict`](git-explain-conflict) - display history of changes
  that led to merge conflict.
- Common aliases/shorthands, including [`co`, `br` and `st`](.gitconfig#L7)
- Additional log aliases [`la`, `ll`, `lp`](.gitconfig#L30) to show more
  information from repo history.

Settings that should have been the default:
- improved output layout and coloring for `status`, `blame` and `log`,
- better display of merge conflicts, info about copied files etc.


Other good stuff
